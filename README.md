# Data Mining
Data Mining exam group project.

The goal of this project is to use data mining techniques on a dataset containing audio from 24 actor professions. The first part of the project was on structured data, and we did: data understanding and preparation, clustering, classification and regression, and finally pattern mining.
The second part is divided into two parts: the first part still takes place on structured data, so we did imbalanced learning, outlier detection, and advanced classification and regression. In the second part, we used the original audio, so we did time series data understating and preparation, motifs/discords and clustering, classification, and explainable AI. 

In the repository there are 2 folders:<br>
-DM foundations, the first part of the project, contains the pdf report and the Python notebooks;<br>
-DM advanced topics and applications, the second part of the project, which also includes the pdf report and the python notebooks.
